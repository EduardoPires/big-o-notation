# Big-O - Definition, Examples and Benchmark
In a nutshell, Big-O is a rating for the complexity of the algorithm based on the cost or processing time.

## **Big-O - Notations**
Big-O notations are mathematical notations that can be used to describe the complexity of the algorithm.

### O(1) (constant)
There is no growth in the number of operations as it does not depend on the volume of input data (n).

### O(log n) (logarithmic) 
The growth in the number of operations is less than the growth in the number of items.

### O(n) (linear)
The growth in the number of operations is directly proportional to the growth in the number of items.

### O(n log n) (Linearithmic or quasilinear)
It is the result of operations **(log n)** performed **n** times.

### O(n^2) (quadratic)
Occurs when data items are processed in pairs, often with repetitions within each other.

### O(2^n) (exponential)
As n increases, the analyzed factor (time or space) increases exponentially.

### O(n!) (factorial)
The number of executed instructions grows very quickly for a small amount of data.
